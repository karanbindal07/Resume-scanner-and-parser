# üß† Your Goal in Short:
# Use a neural network (ANN) to:

# Understand what skills are expected in the JD

# Learn what skills are available in the resume

# Predict what's missing or irrelevant

# Loop/check multiple times (i.e. confidence aggregation / ensemble-like)

# üß≠ Key Pointers: How to Build This from Scratch
# Here‚Äôs a detailed outline broken into 5 phases with tips & code hints.

# ‚úÖ Phase 1: Dataset Preparation
# You'll need training data that maps:

# Job description ‚Üí list of required skills
    
# Resume ‚Üí list of claimed skills

# Labelled outcomes like ["match", "missing", "extra"] or a match score

# üì¶ Sources for Training Data:
# Indeed job listings

# Resume datasets on Kaggle (e.g. Resume Dataset)

# Generate synthetic data using:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# # Pair job skill set with resumes missing skills randomly
# ‚úÖ Phase 2: Skill Extraction with Embeddings (Input Prep)
# Before the NN, convert text into numbers:

# 1. Pre-trained model for embeddings:
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# def get_vector(text):
#     return embedder.encode(text)
# 2. Skill extractor:
# Use a skill list or train a Named Entity Recognition model (spaCy or custom BiLSTM-CRF).

# ‚úÖ Phase 3: Design the Neural Network
# Use PyTorch or TensorFlow/Keras.

# üîß Example: Keras Functional Model
# python
# Copy
# Edit
# from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
# from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Concatenate

# # Inputs: JD vector and Resume vector
# jd_input = Input(shape=(384,), name="job_desc_vector")      # from SBERT
# res_input = Input(shape=(384,), name="resume_vector")       # from SBERT

# # Concatenate + hidden layers
# x = Concatenate()([jd_input, res_input])
# x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
# x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
# x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)

# # Output: Score (0 to 1) or multi-label prediction
# score_output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name="match_score")(x)

# model = Model(inputs=[jd_input, res_input], outputs=score_output)
# model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# ‚úÖ Phase 4: Training
# Train using X = [jd_vector, resume_vector], y = [match_score or label]

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# # Example: Fake data for test
# import numpy as np

# jd_vecs = np.random.rand(1000, 384)
# res_vecs = np.random.rand(1000, 384)
# y = np.random.rand(1000, 1)  # random match scores

# model.fit([jd_vecs, res_vecs], y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
# ‚úÖ Phase 5: Accuracy Loop (Multiple Evaluations)
# Instead of evaluating once, run k rounds with noise/jitter or dropout at inference (like Monte Carlo Dropout):

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

# def predict_multiple_times(jd_vec, res_vec, times=5):
#     scores = []
#     for _ in range(times):
#         pred = model.predict([jd_vec, res_vec])
#         scores.append(pred[0][0])
#     avg = sum(scores) / len(scores)
#     return avg
# üéØ Output
# From your model:

# Match score (from 0 to 1)

# Based on outputs, you can infer:

# üî• Skills match well

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Skills missing

# üßä Skills not needed

# You can even expand this to multi-class or multi-label output:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# # Output layer for classifying each skill into:
# # 'present', 'missing', 'irrelevant'
# skill_output = Dense(num_skills, activation='sigmoid')
# ‚úÖ Summary: What You Need to Build
# Component	Tool / Library	Purpose
# Text Embeddings	sentence-transformers	Vectorize resume/JD
# Neural Network	Keras / PyTorch	Match predictor
# Data	Synthetic or real	Training input
# Skill Extractor	Custom / spaCy	Extract skills as labels
# Confidence Averaging	Loop inference	Multi-run accuracy check

# Ask ChatGPT
# You said:
# Before the NN, convert text into numbers:

# why 


# ChatGPT said:
# Great question ‚Äî let me explain clearly:

# ü§ñ Why Do We Convert Text Into Numbers Before a Neural Network?
# Neural networks can‚Äôt understand raw text like this:

# plaintext
# Copy
# Edit
# ‚ÄúLooking for a Python developer with AWS experience.‚Äù
# Instead, they require numerical input ‚Äî fixed-length vectors (arrays of floats) ‚Äî so they can do matrix operations (multiplication, addition, etc.) during training and prediction.

# ‚úÖ What We Use to Do That: Text Embeddings
# To convert text into meaningful vectors, we use embeddings, like:

# Sentence embeddings from sentence-transformers (e.g. SBERT)

# Word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe (less common now)

# TF-IDF / Bag of Words (simpler alternatives, but less semantic)

# These models encode the meaning of the sentence into a vector, like:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# [0.11, -0.27, 0.05, ..., 0.92]  # 384-dim vector
# Then your neural network can understand:

# Similarity between JD and resume

# Relationships between skills

# Context like "TensorFlow" vs "Neural Network"

# üîÅ Example
# Job Description:

# Looking for a Python developer with AWS.

# Resume:

# Experienced in AWS, Python, Flask, Docker.

# You encode both as:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# jd_vec = embedder.encode(jd_text)         # e.g., 384 dimensions
# res_vec = embedder.encode(resume_text)    # same dimensions
# Then feed both into the NN:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# model.predict([jd_vec, res_vec])
# üß† In Short:
# Text ‚Üí Numbers ‚Üí Neural Net ‚Üí Score/Output

# Without converting to vectors, your ANN won‚Äôt work ‚Äî it‚Äôs like giving algebra to someone who only understands calculus.

# Let me know if you want a visual breakdown or want to test with some real vector examples!
